<h1>About me</h1>
<p> My name is Rex Nesbit. I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, 
although, I also claim Arizona as home too since most of my family lives here and my wife's also. 
Some of my interests include:
Hockey, Movies, "The Office", playing games with my family and I really want to get into woodworking.
We also just had our first child. A beautiful baby girl named Ffion.
